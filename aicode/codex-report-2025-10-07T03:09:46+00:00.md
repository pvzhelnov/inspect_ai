- User request: "This doesn't work. You will have to migrate OllamaAPI to ModelAPI, that's the only way. Make sure to preserve ALL current functionality because it's still openai compatible EXCEPT two things:
- this api url must be used: \"http://localhost:11434/api/chat\"
- format is passed as follows:

curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
    -d '{

                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",

once done and pytest passes, don't forget to update your codex report."
- Environment setup: ran `make install` to refresh editable dependencies before reworking the provider transport.
- Provider migration: rewrote `OllamaAPI` as a `ModelAPI` implementation that sends requests to `/api/chat`, emits top-level `format` schemas, preserves tool emulation, and surfaces OpenAI-compatible error handling through httpx.
- HTTP plumbing: introduced an `OpenAIAsyncHttpxClient` with `HttpxHooks` so request IDs, authorization headers, and retries behave identically to the previous OpenAI-compatible client.
- Structured output coverage: expanded `tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py` to assert the documented payload, header propagation, lack of query parameters, and reasoning merges using patched httpx calls.
- Experiment command: executed `INSPECT_DISPLAY=plain make experiment` and observed the expected connection failure because no Ollama daemon is listening in the container.
- Tests: ran `pytest tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py -q` to validate the regression suite.
