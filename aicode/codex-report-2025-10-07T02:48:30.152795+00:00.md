- Environment setup: ran `make install` to refresh the editable `inspect-ai` build alongside provider dependencies before debugging the Ollama transport path.
- Structured output payloads: updated `OllamaAPI.completion_params` to emit the raw JSON schema in the top-level `format` field (dropping the OpenAI-specific `json_schema` envelope) and added a service-model override so the outgoing payload uses `llama3.1` exactly as documented.
- HTTP bridge: kept the custom `_generate_completion` to strip OpenAI sentinels and merge reasoning extras while posting directly to `/chat/completions`.
- Regression coverage: rewrote the structured-output test to compare against the documented Ollama payload, added a new reasoning merge check, and confirmed response parsing remains unchanged.
- Experiment check: executed `INSPECT_DISPLAY=plain make experiment` and captured the expected connection failure because no Ollama server listens inside the CI container.
- Tests: ran `pytest tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py -q` to validate the new regression suite.
