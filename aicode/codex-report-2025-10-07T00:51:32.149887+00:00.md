- Ollama provider: Translate `response_schema` metadata into the provider-specific `format` request field and preserve schema description/title values when forwarding JSON Schema payloads.
- Model API: Clarify that `ResponseSchema.strict` is ignored by Ollama and extend the `GenerateConfig` documentation to list Ollama alongside other providers that accept JSON schema outputs.
- Tests: Restructure the Ollama parameter-mapping regression test to follow provider test conventions by using pytest fixtures and direct instance method calls.
- Tooling: Added a Codex change report for this branch detailing structured-output handling improvements and accompanying test updates.
