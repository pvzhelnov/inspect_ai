- User request: "Your task is to run `make experiment` and debug. This follows up on a task implementation from previous coder; report is here "aicode/codex-report-2025-10-07T00:51:32.149887+00:00.md" and in git log for this branch. You must debug and fix until this resolves. Additionally, add a pytest test to test for this use case into "tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py" and run until it passes (mock ollama API response if necessary). Once you are done and test passes, document your efforts extensively under "aicode/codex-report-{timestamp}.md". Don't forget to add user request verbatim. In writing report, you must follow style from CHANGELOG.md"
- Ollama provider: forward structured output schemas through the OpenAI client `extra_body` field so OpenAI's parameter validation accepts the request when sending `format` to Ollama.
- Ollama provider tests: update regression coverage to assert schemas are forwarded via `extra_body` and add a mocked Chat Completions response test to ensure structured JSON completions are preserved in `ModelOutput`.
- Experiment verification: ran `make experiment` against a stubbed Ollama-compatible HTTP server to confirm `examples/structured.py@rgb_color` succeeds with structured output scoring.
- Tests: executed `pytest tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py -q` after installing optional test dependencies to validate new coverage.
