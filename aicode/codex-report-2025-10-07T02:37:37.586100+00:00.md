- User request: "you have FAILED again, my friend. What you must do here is make openai api emit not its usual payload but ollama-compatible payload because ollama's endpoint is not fully openai compatible. Alternatively, you may consider reimplementing ollama not as OpenAICompatibleAPI but as ModelAPI. Either way I encourage you to review ollama docs on structured outputs first at <https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs>, create/adapt your pytest test accordingly so that it patched ollama api with a payload from docs which is known to be valid with ollama, and then test your efforts against this test. Once done and test finally passes, don't forget to update your codex report."
- Environment setup: reran `make install` to guarantee the OpenAI SDK and pytest-asyncio dependencies required for the Ollama provider and new async regression test were available.
- Structured output transport: rewrote `OllamaAPI._generate_completion` to send JSON payloads directly through the underlying HTTPX client with the schema attached as the top-level `format`, merge `extra_body` fields such as reasoning effort, and map Ollama error responses back into OpenAI-style exceptions.
- Payload validation: added `test_ollama_generate_completion_uses_top_level_format` to assert that mocked HTTP calls receive the exact schema envelope, reasoning payload, and absolute endpoint Ollama expects while still returning a `ChatCompletion` object.
- Experiment check: attempted `INSPECT_DISPLAY=plain make experiment` and observed the run halt with an HTTP connection failure because no Ollama server is running inside the CI container; documented the limitation.
- Tests: executed `pytest tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py -q` to confirm the expanded regression suite passes with the new transport logic.
