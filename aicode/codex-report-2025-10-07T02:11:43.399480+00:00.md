- User request: "The change with `extra_body` is incorrect and doesn't follow Ollama specification for structured outputs. Review it here: https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs\n\nIn addition, I wanted to note that you must run `make install` to avoid issues with missing dependencies like openai.\n\nRevisit the task and don't forget to update your codex report afterward.\n\nYou have FAILED to notice that in ollama docs, format param is passed DIRECTLY in payload, not in extra_body:\n\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/chat -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\n  \"model\": \"llama3.1\",\n  \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Tell me about Canada.\"}],\n  \"stream\": false,\n  \"format\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"capital\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"languages\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n      \"name\",\n      \"capital\", \n      \"languages\"\n    ]\n  }\n}'\n\nAddress and once done and tests pass, don't forget to update your codex report."
- Environment setup: executed `make install` to provision the openai client and other dependencies required by the Ollama provider integration tests.
- Structured output fix: taught `OllamaAPI.completion_params` to emit the Ollama `format` envelope at the top level while preserving schema metadata and let `_generate_completion` mirror that envelope into the outgoing request body without breaking OpenAI SDK validation.
- Regression coverage: refreshed `tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py` to assert the top-level `format` payload and continue verifying JSON completion parsing.
- Experiment verification: launched a lightweight mock Ollama `/v1/chat/completions` server and re-ran `INSPECT_DISPLAY=plain make experiment` to confirm `examples/structured.py@rgb_color` succeeds end to end.
- Tests: ran `pytest tests/model/providers/test_ollama.py -q` to ensure the structured output regression tests pass with the new contract.
